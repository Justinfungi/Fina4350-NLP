During the lecture,  Dr.BUEHLMAIER showed us the spying program for twitter. The program really catch my message and download it on the laptop. While the program can capture the tweets containing words that are specify in a word bank, a question apear in my mind - What kind of words should i monitor?

I think the situations should be complicated given the complex operations in the financial markets. By applying divde-and-conquer method, a categorization should work well to better classify the various need in different situations

From my point of view, a possible way to categorization is that we divided the whole pie into: 

- i) 
- ii) Capital markets, 
- iv) Cryptocurrency markets

The reasons of my division are:

  - i) The first three is the knowledge i obtained form the course [FINA2330 Financial market and institutions], i think that there are different focuses in these different markets, a seperation of word bank increase the possibility that we can scrape useful information. For example, the stock markets should focus on the companies behaviours. Once we fix the profolio of stocks, we can closely monitor the tweet related to thoses companys's operations, such as a large cash flow or some agency problem occured. 
  
  - ii) The fourth one is the learning i gained from my current internship experience [Optymize Potocol @Optymize_xyz]. i noticed that there is a increasing new market in web3. The behaviours of the market are greatly different from those traditional markets. More attention should be put on the scam issue, the extent of success in build the community and son on. 

  -  iii) i do not addd the money market into the word banks. It is because the money markets features in short YTM (year to maturity) and higher opportunity cost. The money market often yield just 2% or 3% while  common stocks have returned about 8% to 10% on average. Although the money market owns the advantages of liquidity, monitoring of this marekt is against the initial puprpose of this project, which is to create a text analytics for a better investment strategies in a longer time interval. Thus, the money market is filtered out.

Considering these reasons, i think it is practical, necessary, and efficient to set up multiple word bank for different markets to yield a high performance in scraping information for financial analytics. 

After the seperation of markets, work bank construction is rather essential.
