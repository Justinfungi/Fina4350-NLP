I have a configuration that is working properly but being careful: I was not able to find a trigger for when GPay is started from the quick notification tile, but only from its own app. So, unless you start it using the quick tile, everything works fine and the trigger is the application being opened.
For closing it, the best way that is working in every case is to look for the notification of the payement. Once the notification received you turn off the NFC, supposing that you have already paid what you wanted.

Other option, that I'm using right now, is to have a task only for turning off the NFC, because when I open GPay if the NFC is off, I have a prompt to turn it on.

So, as I said, that's my case, not perfect but maybe can help you waiting for a more robust answer 

PS: What has pushed me to stop activating the NFC just on Gpay opening is that often I can use GPay just to show some fidelity cards or my flight tickets, and in that case I do not want the NFC to be on."

"If you had to divide these 50 stocks into 5 categories, how would you divvy them up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11llhoc/if_you_had_to_divide_these_50_stocks_into_5/,I'm not sure I understand your question.  But your broker would have all of the information you would need for asset type and sector that you would need to categorize these.

Is google better??,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/11llhky/is_google_better/,I find HomeKit far more intuitive and easy to use than either Amazon or Google. It’s also less intrusive on the privacy front. Siri is a bit dumber when asking questions but just as good for timers and setting scenes and such which is basically everything I use her for.
